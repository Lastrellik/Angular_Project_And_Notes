1. Introduction
  - ng new, ng serve, ng generate, ng test, ng build

2. Angular CLI Overview
  - Purpose is to assist Angular developers with:
    - Build an Angular application
    - Generate Angular files
    - Execute the application
    - Run unit and end to end tests
    - Prepare the application for deployment
  - Must be installed globally
  - ng help helps us out a lot

3. ng new
  - karma is a javascript test runner and is used for our unit tests
  - To support older browsers, uncomment lines in the polyfills.ts file

4. ng serve
  - launches our development server on port 4200
  - npm start runs ng serve
  - -o will open the default browser for us, so we don't have to do it manually
  - ng serve --help will teach us a lot of stuff

5. ng generate
  - ng g --help I'm sure will show me everything I need to do

6. ng test
  - ng test --help
  - ng e2e runs our end to end tests using protractor

7. ng build
  - Outputs similar to the ng serve command, but actually generates the files we can deploy.
  - When deploying to production, we want to minify and "tree shake" which drops out dead branches or unused pieces.
  - If we precompile before deploying, things will run faster for us. This takes care of something called AOT, or ahead of time compiling
  - adding --prod takes care of all of this for us. Including hashes. This makes the browser download the latest version instead of using what's in the cache
  - ng build --help has a lot of other options for us for when we want to deploy prod.

8. Checklists and Summary
  - ng help, ng new, ng serve, ng generate, ng test, ng e2e, ng build
