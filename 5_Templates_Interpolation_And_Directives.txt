1. Introduction
  - component has a template, class, and metadata (set by component decorator)

2. Building a template
  - We can define an Inline template with backticks or a single line with quotes
  - Linked Templates are defined with the templateUrl property to provide the URL to the HTML file

3. Building the Component
4. Binding with Interpolation
  - Coordinates communication between the component's class and its template and often involves passing data
  - Interpolation is a one-way binding from the class property to the template.
    - Like the <h1>{{pageTitle}}</h1>
    - We can also do concatination, math, etc.
    - Template expression is inside those curly braces

5. Adding Logic with Directives
  - Directive - Custom HTML element or attribute used to power up and extend our HTML
    - We can use Angular or our own directive
    - Angular has structural directives like *ngIf or *ngFor.
      - The star marks it as a structural directive
    - *ngIf
      - Structural directive that removes or recreates a portion of the dom tree based on an expression
      - if the expression defines to false, the elements are removed from the dom.

6. Adding Logic with Directives
  - for of vs for in
    - for of iterates over iterable objects, resulting in the objects themselves
    - for in iterates over properties of objects and returns indexes, like 1,2,3
