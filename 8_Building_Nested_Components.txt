1. Introduction
  - Using a component
    - Can be used as a directive
    - As a routing target, so it appears like they traveled to another view
  - What makes a component nestable?
    - It is if its template only manages a fragment of a larger view, if it has a selector, and communicates with its parent container.

2. Building a Nested Component
  - Outer components are 'containers' or 'parent components', nested are 'nested' or 'child component'
  - We want to change the star number to actual stars

3. Using a nested component as a directive
  -specify its directive in the template

4. Passing Data to a Nested Component (@Input)
  - There's an @Input decorator
    - Declared in the nested component's class on any property
  - We'll use property binding in the template to send it to the nested component

5. Passing Data from a Component to a container
  - Kind of like @Input(), but @Output()
